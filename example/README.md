# Example App

A local Expo SDK 57 app showing `@apollohg/react-native-rich-text-editor` as a single, full-screen document editor with every editor feature switched on.

The package requires Expo Modules, and Expo SDK 57 is the version tested in this repo.

## What it shows

One screen: a title bar, and the editor filling the rest of the screen with the toolbar attached to the keyboard.

| Feature        | Where                                                                                                    |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Marks          | Bold, italic, underline, strikethrough buttons                                                           |
| Headings       | A `menu` group offering levels 1 through 6                                                               |
| Links          | The link button opens a URL sheet driven by `onRequestLink`; saving an empty URL removes the link        |
| Images         | The image button opens the photo library through `onRequestImage`; picks are downscaled before insertion |
| Lists          | A menu group with bullet, numbered, and task lists, indent and outdent                                   |
| Task lists     | `taskList.ts` adds the checklist nodes to the schema; tap a checkbox to toggle it, or use the list menu  |
| Blocks         | Blockquote button, plus divider and line break in the insert menu                                        |
| History        | Undo and redo at the end of the toolbar                                                                  |
| Mentions       | Type `@` to see suggestions filtered by the query through `onQueryChange`                                |
| Custom atoms   | The counter card is a React component inside the document; the insert menu's counter action adds another |
| Image resizing | `allowImageResizing` is on, so a selected image shows native resize handles                              |

## Layout

```
App.tsx                      Screen composition, editor wiring, image picking
content.ts                   Initial document (JSON), mention suggestions, toolbar items
theme.ts                     The one palette, spacing scale, editor and mention themes
taskList.ts                  Checklist node specs and the schema helper that adds them
components/CounterCard.tsx   The custom atom node and its React component
components/LinkEditorModal.tsx  URL sheet driven by onRequestLink
```

## Install

From the repository root:

```sh
cd example
npm install
```

## Prebuild

This package contains native code, so generate the native projects before building:

```sh
npm run prebuild
```

This runs Expo Prebuild in clean, non-installing mode. The generated `ios/` and `android/` directories are ignored, disposable, and must not contain source changes. Put native configuration in `app.config.ts` or the package config plugin.

The `ios` and `android` run commands prebuild their platform automatically. Run `npm run prebuild` directly when both projects are needed. Android device-test settings belong in the ignored `example/.android-device-test.env` file so regeneration cannot delete them.

## Run

From the repository root:

```sh
npm run run:example:ios
npm run run:example:android
```

Or directly inside `example/`:

```sh
npm run ios
npm run android
```

## Notes

- This package contains native code, so use a development build, not Expo Go.
- The example app depends on the local package via `file:..` and resolves its types from `dist/`, so run the package build after changing `src/`.
- If you change native code or Rust bindings, rebuild the app after updating the package binaries.
- If the native build fails after pulling new changes, try running prebuild again.
- The editor uses `heightBehavior="fixed"` and scrolls internally. On iOS the sheet keeps its full height and the native editor adjusts its bottom scroll inset for keyboard overlap and reveals the selection; on Android the activity's resize behavior shrinks the window instead.
